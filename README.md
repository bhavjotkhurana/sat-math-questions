# SAT Math Practice Questions

This repository contains a collection of SAT-style math practice questions and their solutions in LaTeX format. The questions are organized into four main topics:
- **Algebra**
- **Geometry & Trigonometry**
- **Problem Solving & Data Analysis**
- **Advanced Math**

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to eventually integrate these questions into QScroll. In the meantime, the generated PDF files offer a convenient way to practice and review SAT math problems.

## Contents

- **LaTeX Source Files**: The main documents and additional snippets for each topic.
  - `questions.tex`: The primary LaTeX document with the questions.
  - `solutions.tex`: The LaTeX document containing solutions.
  - Additional sections/snippets for extra questions in each category.
- **PDFs**: Compiled versions of the documents for easy practice.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Documents**:
   - Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
   - Run `pdflatex questions.tex` (or use your preferred LaTeX editor) to generate a PDF of the questions.
   - Similarly, compile the solutions file (if provided) to review the answers.

2. **Practice**:
   - Use the generated PDFs for self-study and practice.
   - Future plans include integrating these questions into QScroll for an enhanced, interactive experience.
